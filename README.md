## About
Welcome to my course *Understanding Reinforcement Learning*! This course will be split up into two parts:
* Part I: Theory and Math
* Part II: Implementing Reinforcement Learning in Python 

By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding on what reinforcement learning is, the mathematical foundation of reiforcement learning, Markov Decision Process (MDP), Q-learning, Deep-Q Learning, and how you can implement all of these skills using python in a real world project!

## Prerequisites

Before starting the Reinforcement Learning course, it's recommended to have the following skills and knowledge:

1. **Python Programming Skills:** Object-oriented programing skills in Python.

2. **Foundational Mathematics:** Understanding of basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory will be helpful for comprehending the algorithms and concepts.

3. **Machine Learning Basics:** Familiarity with fundamental concepts in machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, will provide a good foundation.

4. **Understanding of Algorithms and Data Structures:** Basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures will aid in comprehending the logic and implementation of RL algorithms.

5. **Familiarity with Markov Processes:** Having a basic understanding of Markov processes and probability will be beneficial for understanding Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

6. **Neural Networks:** Basic understanding of neural networks and their functioning will be useful.
   
7. **Experience with Frameworks:** Familiarity with machine learning/deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be beneficial for implementing algorithms. We will be using PyTorch.
